                "One of the goals of Primal was to give it a strong horror theme. To accomplish this, the crew drew influence from multiple sources, including Conan The Barbarian, Osamu Tezuka, Frank Frazetta, Moebius, Ralph Bakshi, and Heavy Metal Magazine.",

                "In an interview following the second season finale, Genndy Tartakovsky stated that season 2 concluded Spear and Fang's story, and has expressed interest in exploring other stories with different characters if there are future seasons of Primal."
